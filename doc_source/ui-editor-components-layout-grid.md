# LayoutGrid<a name="ui-editor-components-layout-grid"></a>

You can use a layout grid component to organize child elements into a uniform grid\. To use this feature, you add the layout grid component to an element and then add child elements\. The UI system positions the child elements in a grid pattern\. You can choose whether the child elements are positioned left to right or right to left, and bottom to top or top to bottom\. The child elements can contain a texture or image, a piece of text, a button, a check box, more columns, rows, grids, and so on\. The size of each child is determined by the **Cell Size** property and is independent of each child's content\.

To see an in\-game example of a completed canvas with the **LayoutGrid** component, open the level UiFeatures in the project SamplesProject\. Press **Ctrl\+G** to play the game, and then choose **Components**, **Layout Components**, **Layout Grid**\. You can view examples of different fill patterns\. Press **Esc** to exit the game\.

To view this same canvas in the **UI Editor**, navigate to the `\Gems\LyShineExamples\Assets\UI\Canvases\LyShineExamples\Comp\Layout ` directory and open the `SimpleGrid.uicanvas` file\.

You can add a prebuilt **Layout Grid** element from the slice library\. When you do this, a simple layout grid is automatically created and nested in your **Hierarchy** pane\.

**To add a Layout Grid element from the slice library**
+ In the [**UI Editor**](ui-editor-using.md), choose **New**, **Element from Slice Library**, **LayoutGrid**\.

**To edit a layout grid component**  
In the **Properties** pane of the [**UI Editor**](ui-editor-using.md), expand **LayoutGrid** and do the following, as appropriate:    
****Padding****  
Type values in pixels, relative to the element's borders\.  
****Spacing****  
Type values in pixels to adjust spacing among elements\.  
****Cell size****  
Type values in pixels to specify the size of the child elements\.  
****Order****  
 Do the following as appropriate:  
+  For **Horizontal**, select **Left\-to\-Right** or **Right\-to\-Left** to determine the order in which elements appear horizontally\.
+ For **Vertical**, select **Top\-to\-Bottom** or **Bottom\-to\-Top** to determine the order in which elements appear vertically\.
+ For **Starting With**, select **Horizontal** or **Vertical** to determine whether elements appear horizontally or vertically first\.  
****Child Alignment****  
If the layout's children don't occupy all the available layout space, this setting determines how the children are aligned\.  
For **Horizontal**, select **Left**, **Center**, or **Right** to determine how the children are aligned horizontally\.   
For **Vertical**, select **Top**, **Center**, or **Bottom** to determine how the children are aligned vertically\.
