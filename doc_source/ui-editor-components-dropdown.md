# Dropdown<a name="ui-editor-components-dropdown"></a>

You can use the **Dropdown** component to make an element behave like a drop\-down menu\. Use this component with child elements that contain content\. The child elements provide the contents of the drop\-down menu\.

You can use the **Dropdown** component with the **DropdownOption** component\. With the **DropdownOption** component, you can configure options to change the menu text and its icon after it is selected\.

To see in\-game examples of completed canvases with the **Dropdown** component, open the level UiFeatures in the project SamplesProject\.
