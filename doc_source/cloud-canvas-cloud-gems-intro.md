|  Some cloud Gems have been deprecated and are no longer supported\.  | 

A cloud gem is an individual package of specific cloud\-connected functionality, assets, and AWS resource definitions\. A cloud gem includes everything required for you to add cloud\-connected functionality to your project\.

Lumberyard includes the following cloud gems\. You can enable them in a project from the [Lumberyard Project Configurator](configurator-intro.md) tool\.
+ [Compute Farm](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-compute-farm.md) **\(deprecated\)** – Divide and conquer large\-scale tasks for processing on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances\.
+ [Defect Reporter](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-defect-reporter-intro.md) **\(deprecated\)** – Streamlines and customizes the collection and management of defect report data from users\. 
+ [Dynamic Content](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-dc-manager.md) – Allows Lumberyard `.pak` files that contain new and updated game assets to be uploaded to the cloud for later automatic downloading to the game client\.
+ [Game Metrics](cloud-canvas-metrics-gem.md) **\(deprecated\)** – Collects event data on player behaviors for analysis or triggering event actions\.
+  [In\-Game Survey](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-in-game-survey.md) **\(deprecated\)** – Create surveys for your game, test them, and publish them\.
+ [Leaderboard](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-leaderboard.md) **\(deprecated\)** – Stores a player's high scores and provides leaderboards that show player rankings\.
+ [Message Of The Day](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-message-of-the-day.md) **\(deprecated\)** – Schedules the delivery of messages \(for example, new product announcements or holiday greetings\) to game clients\.
+ [Player Account](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-player-account.md) – Provides a standalone player authentication and management solution that uses Amazon Cognito\.
+  [Speech Recognition](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-speech-recognition-intro.md) **\(deprecated\)** – Add speech recognition and natural language processing to your Lumberyard game\. The Speech Recognition Cloud Gem uses the [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) service, which recognizes and understands spoken input\.
+ [](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-text-to-speech-intro.md) **\(deprecated\)** – Enhance your gameplay and workflows with synthesized speech\. The Cloud Canvas Text\-to\-Speech \(TTS\) Cloud Gem uses [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/), which is a text\-to\-speech service that turns text into lifelike speech\.
+  [Web Communicator](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-web-communicator.md) – Send AWS cloud service events to your game's connected editors or clients\. Your editors or game clients can use this information to update themselves without having to poll AWS for updates\.
