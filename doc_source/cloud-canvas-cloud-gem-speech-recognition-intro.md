|  This cloud Gem is deprecated and no longer supported\. Some functionality is broken because of its dependency on the Cloud Gem Portal, which was removed in Lumberyard 1\.28\. Documentation on this Gem from previous versions of Lumberyard can be found in the [Documentation Archive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/lumberyard-documentation-archive.html)\.  | 

You can use the Speech Recognition Cloud Gem to add speech recognition and natural language processing to your Lumberyard game\. The Speech Recognition Cloud Gem uses the [Amazon Lex service](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/), which recognizes the intent of spoken player input so that your game can react accordingly\. Your players can use natural language and do not have to memorize or use specific phrases to initiate commands\.
