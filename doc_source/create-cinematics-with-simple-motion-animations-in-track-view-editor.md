# Creating Character Animations with the Simple Motion Component<a name="create-cinematics-with-simple-motion-animations-in-track-view-editor"></a>

To create character animations with the Track View, you can add the **Simple Motion** component and the **Actor** component to an entity\. You then add the entity to a track view sequence and specify the motions that you want your character to animate\. When you add a motion track to a track view sequence, the Track View drives animation on the **Simple Motion** component and its properties: 
+ **Motion**
+ **Play speed**
+ **Play time**
+ **Blend in time**
+ **Blend out time**

For more information, see the **[Simple Motion](component-simple-motion.md)** component\.

**Note**  
The **Play speed** property is always set to `0.0`\. This is because the Track View will set the **Play time** value every frame to drive the playback of the motion\. This allows scrubbing and playback in the Track View as well as playback in the game\.
When you add the **Simple Motion** component to a track view sequence, the **Preview in Editor** property is automatically enabled\.

The following procedure uses [Starter Game](sample-level-starter-game.md)\.

**To add the Simple Motion component in the Track View editor**

1. In Lumberyard Editor, right\-click in the viewport and choose **Create entity**\. 

1. Enter a name for the entity\.

1. In the **Entity Inspector**, click **Add Component**, and then choose the **Simple Motion** component\.

1. Add the **[Actor](component-actor.md)** component\.

1. In the **Actor** component, for **Actor asset**, specify an actor file\. For example, you can specify the `Jack.fbx` file\.   
**Example**  

   Your entity should look like the following\.   
![\[Components for the entity to add to the track view sequence.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/cinematics/cinematics-track-view-simple-motion-component-1.png)

1. In Lumberyard Editor, choose **Tools**, **Track View**\. 

1. Click the **Add Sequence **icon ![\[Add track view sequence icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/cinematics/cinematics-track-view-simple-motion-component-2.png), enter a sequence name, and then click **OK**\.

1. Select the entity in the viewport, right\-click the sequence, and then choose **Add Selected Entity**\.

   This adds the entity and its components to the track view sequence\.  
![\[Entity and components added to the track view sequence.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/cinematics/cinematics-track-view-simple-motion-component-3.png)

1. Right\-click** Simple Motion**, choose **Add Track**, and then choose the **Motion** option\.

1. In the timeline, for **Simple Motion**, double\-click to create to a key\.

1. Click the key and in the **Key Properties** dialog box, specify the following:

   1. For **Motion**, click the folder icon and specify the motion file, such as `jack_idle_to_walk.motion`\.

   1. Specify the parameters that you want, such as the **Start Time** and **End Time**\.
**Note**  
You can set the **Loop** parameter so that motion continues to play as long as the track view sequence is set\.  
**Example**    
![\[Key properties for the first motion.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/cinematics/cinematics-track-view-simple-motion-component-4.png)

1. Click the play icon ![\[Play the track view sequence\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/cinematics/cinematics-track-view-simple-motion-component-5.png) to view the animation in the track view sequence\. You can also drag the Track View needle across the timeline\.   
**Example**  

   The following shows the actor animating the idle to walk motion\.  
![\[Example animation of a single motion in the track view sequence.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/shared-cinematics-track-view-simple-motion-component-6-example.gif)

**Note**  
When you update properties in the Track View, the original values for the entity properties are overwritten and are not restored\. For example, if you set the **Start time** to `3.0` in the Track View, this updates the **Simple Motion** component properties in the **Entity Inspector**\. If you want to reuse an entity with a **Simple Motion** component after a track view sequence is completed, update the **Play speed** parameter; the **Play speed** parameter always resets to zero in the Track View\. You can also avoid this issue by not reusing entities in this way\.

## Blending Motions in the Track View Editor<a name="blending-motions-in-track-view-editor"></a>

The **Simple Motion** component supports two motions at a time for blending: the currently playing motion and the previously played motion\. For example, you can blend two motions so that your actor smoothly transitions between a walk motion to a run motion\.

You can set the **Blend In Time** and **Blend Out Time** properties for simple animation blending\. 
+ **Blend In Time** – Specifies how long it takes for the motion that is set to fully blend in from zero to one second\.
+ **Blend Out Time** – Specifies how long it will take for a motion to fully blend out from one to zero second\.

To blend two motions, overlap two animations and set the **Blend Out Time** of the last motion to `0.33` seconds, and the **Blend In Time** of the next motion by `0.33` seconds\. This allows the two motions to smoothly chain together in the track view sequence\.

**Note**  
If you want your animation to start when the game starts, click the **Edit Sequence** icon ![\[Edit track view sequence icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/cinematics/cinematics-track-view-simple-motion-component-6.png) and in the **Edit Sequence** dialog box, select **Autostart**, and then click **OK**\. For more information, see [Setting Sequence Properties](cinematics-sequence-props.md)\.
The **Blend In Time** and **Blend Out Time** parameters affect the bone weight that are set in your DCC\.

**To blend motions in the Track View Editor**

1. Double\-click the first key and for **Blend Out Time**, enter `0.33`\. This allows the first motion, `jack_idle_to_walk.motion`, to blend into the next motion\.  
**Example**    
![\[Key properties for the first motion for blending.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/cinematics/cinematics-track-view-simple-motion-component-7.png)

1. For the **Simple Motion** track, double\-click the timeline to create a second key\.

1. Double\-click the key again and in the **Key Properties** dialog box, specify the following:

   1. For **Motion**, click the folder icon and specify the next motion, such as the `jack_strafe_run_forwards.motion` file\.

   1. Specify the parameters that you want, such as the **Start Time** and **End Time**\. For **Blend In Time**, enter `0.33`\. This allows enough time to overlap with the previous motion\.  
**Example**  

     
![\[Key properties for the second motion for blending.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/cinematics/cinematics-track-view-simple-motion-component-8.png)

1. Select and drag the second key so that overlaps with the first motion track\. 

1. Repeat steps 2 to 4 to add additional motions\. For a motion that is ending, enter `0.33` for **Blend Out Time**\. For the motion that starts next, enter `0.33` for **Blend In Time**\.  
**Example**  

   The following is a timeline with four motions blended together\.  
![\[Timeline in a track view sequence with four motions.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/cinematics/cinematics-track-view-simple-motion-component-9.png)

1. Click the play icon to view the track view sequence\. You can also drag the Track View needle across the timeline\. The motions blend together in the track view sequence\.  
**Example**
