# Illuminance and Auto Exposure Key<a name="enviro-lighting-luminance-scene-key"></a>

Also known as luminous flux density, illuminance is the total amount of visible light falling on a point on a surface from all directions above the surface in a given time\. Proper illuminance values ensures the environment lighting in your level closely models real\-world values\. Besides simply having good ratios between light and dark, accurate illuminance values ensure that tone\-mapping, and eye adaptation works optimally\.

The following table lists real\-world illuminance values, expressed in luminous flux \(lux\)\. Lux is the unit of illuminance and luminous emittance, measuring lux per unit area, and equal to one lumen per square meter\.

 


**Illuminance Values**  

| Real\-world illuminance | Lux Value | Uniformity Ratio | Artistic Interpretation | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Full moon | 0\.25 | 0\.00005 | \- | 
| Living room | 50 | 0\.01 | \- | 
| Clear sunrise | 400 | 0\.08 | \- | 
| Office | 500 | 0\.1 | \- | 
| TV studio | 1,000 | 0\.2 | \- | 
| Overcast day | 15,000 | 3\.0 | \~ 1\.5 | 
| Indirect sunlight \(in shadow\) | 20,000 | 4\.0 | \~ 2\.0 | 
| Direct sunlight | 100,000 | 20\.0 | \~ 10\.0 | 

The **Auto Exposure Key** setting controls the amount of light exposure and determines whether the tone\-mapped image appears relatively bright or dark\. This setting is calculated automatically from the average scene illuminance, which is why it is important to use standard real\-world illuminance levels\. For other settings that affect the tone mapping of a scene, see [HDR Settings](enviro-lighting-hdr-tone-mapping.md)\.

Lumberyard's auto\-exposure mode works in exposure value \(EV\) units and can be enabled using the **r\_HDREyeAdaptationMode** console variable\.

The following settings are used to achieve the desired illuminance in an environment level\. See [Setting Daytime Atmospheric Effects](sky-day-atmosphere.md) for more information\.
