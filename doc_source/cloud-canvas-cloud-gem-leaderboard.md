|  This cloud Gem is deprecated and no longer supported\. Some functionality is broken because of its dependency on the Cloud Gem Portal, which was removed in Lumberyard 1\.28\. Documentation on this Gem from previous versions of Lumberyard can be found in the [Documentation Archive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/lumberyard-documentation-archive.html)\.  | 

You can use the Leaderboard cloud gem to create, view, and customize leaderboards by deleting scores, banning players, and removing bans\.
