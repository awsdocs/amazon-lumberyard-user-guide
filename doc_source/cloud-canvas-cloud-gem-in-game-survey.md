|  This cloud Gem is deprecated and no longer supported\. Some functionality is broken because of its dependency on the Cloud Gem Portal, which was removed in Lumberyard 1\.28\. Documentation on this Gem from previous versions of Lumberyard can be found in the [Documentation Archive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/lumberyard-documentation-archive.html)\.  | 

You can use the In\-Game Survey Cloud Gem to create surveys for your game and test them in the **InGameSurveySample**\. Your players can see active surveys and submit answers to them\.
