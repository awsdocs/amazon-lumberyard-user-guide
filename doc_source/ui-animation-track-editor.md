**Note**  
When you preview an animation or move the playback position on the timeline, it moves the UI elements in the **UI Editor**\. This means that, if you then save the canvas, these UI elements will be saved in this position\.   
Reposition the timeline or preview a different sequence to position the UI elements at the positions in which you want them to load before you save the canvas\.
